  -Replace empty values with "--"
  -REFACTOR PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
  -update readme
  -write blog
  -push to github
  -??
  -profit


##UPDATE##
Upon going [back] every star entry and planet entry duplicates
^^FIXED: rerouted [back] through CLI.systems_within_distance




# git status: shows all files and changes made
# git add . :saves all files that have been modified
# git commit -m "short update list"
# git push -u origin master (-u is one time thing)
^^ all equal git submit

# git branch? :make a separate branch
# git revert? :revert to older commit

# git remote add origin "url"  ## url: git@github.com:Hunter-Kolasa/CLI_Exoplanets.git

What will the code do?
// welcome user
// users will have access to TONS of star systems -> exoplanets within selected distance
//
//..can access individual planetary information on system name, # of planets in system, 
        planet name, distance, size/mass, temperature
//..^^ all at once or indiviudally(?)
// users have ability to move forwards and backwards without exiting program


CLI class -  deal with things showing on terminal
api class - get/deal with all info coming from api
exoplanet class - object information
input_to_api - takes user input from cli.rb and turns it into viable inputs for api get
